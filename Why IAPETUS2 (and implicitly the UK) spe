1. Why IAPETUS2 (and implicitly the UK) specifically?
   - Talk about the advantages of the IAPETUS program such as budget, training opportunities,networking, internship with a non-research institution if you'd like, the dual supervision, access to the facilities from both universities, Stirling and Newscastle traditional in ecology and expertise of the supervisors. Also, since the project is in Brazil, it is an opportunity for you to collaborate with leading researchers in the UK.

Newcastle: modelling, evidence and policy group - really good with experimental plant ecology
Stirling: ecosystem change group, tropical ecology and climate change.

2. How can you contibute to the project specifically, maybe a new approach or a different method? Maybe a new view or questions within the framework.

   - Individual trait distibution and ranges instead of CWMs, testing coexistente models using traits.

3. Is there a particular piece of research that you are particularly proud of?

   - More contemporary view to plant assembly in Brazil, not only based on environmental filters but also the role of biotic interactions. Mention the Cadotte paper.

   - Be very direct, make it like an "abstract".

4. Being Brazilian, you can speak the language and you know the culture, so you could make sure your research has the strongest.

5. How to bring direct impact to the local people, society and conservation?

- Populations depend on the forest for extracting resources, for sustainable fisheries, and for flood regulation itself. Also hydropower is a big threat not only to the ecosystem but to the populations too, so providiging more evidence that large enterprises.

6. What is your experience working with a team and engaging with stakeholders (politicians, park managers, land owners, ngos, etc).

- Most field and lab activities were done as a team, with all students supporting each other's projects. That was very good for everyone to learn more taxonomy, more lab and field methods, but also working with diffrent people and learning to respect their differences.

- I interacted with the Park director and park staff to explain the objectives of the research and get their trust and feedback. Not much opportunity but looking forward to develop these skills given the wider reach of the project.

7. What are your laboratory and field skills that apply to this project.

- Been working with functional trait measurements since 2008, because we didn't have a lot of infrastructure in the lab at that time I learned how to improvise, and eventually learned all the protocols for trait sampling and measurement in the lab. I also had the opportunity to work with forest inventory work in the Atlantic Forest, herb√°rio e taxonomia. Also I have good statistical and computing skills with GLMs, Multivariate Analysis and Species distribution modelling.

8. What skills you are hoping to develop through IAPETUS?

- Programming skills for data analysis and for developing ecological models and simulation, using modern remote sensing methods are advance field equipment and methods that we don't have in Brazil. Also career development, writing skills and presentation skills.

9. What are your expectations for after you graduate?

- Expect to continue a research career focusing on understanding Neotropical biodiversity, which is the most biodiverse region in the world, but also especially the Atlantic Forest region where I grew up which inspired me to become a scientist, and also be able to take the knowledge I learn in the UK to train new Brazilian ecologists.
